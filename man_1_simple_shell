.TH "HSH" 1 "18 April 2024" "1.0" "Simple Shell"
.SH NAME
hsh - command interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh (does not support arguments)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell (hsh) is a command-line interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Made by Holberton School Students.
.SH Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:
-$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
-/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
-$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
-/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
-$
Same error with your program hsh:
-$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
-./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
-$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
-./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
-$

.SH Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
.SH Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
-$ ./hsh
-($) /bin/ls
-hsh main.c shell.c
-($)
-($) exit
-$
But also in non-interactive mode:
-$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
-hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
-$
-$ cat test_ls_2
-/bin/ls
-/bin/ls
-$
-$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
-hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
-hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
-$
.SH OVERVIEW
The shell reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It has both interactive and non-interactive modes. In the interactive mode, commands can be typed directly into the running shell. In the non-interactive mode, commands can be put into a file, and the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.SH SEARCH AND EXECUTION
There are three types of commands: shell functions, built-in commands, and normal programs. Each is executed differently:
- **Shell built-ins**: Executed internally to the shell without spawning a new process.
- **Normal programs**: Searched for in the file system.
- **Shell functions**: First checked by name, then searched as normal programs if not found.
.SH PATH SEARCH
When locating a command, the shell follows these steps:
1. Looks for a shell function with the same name.
2. Searches for a built-in command with the same name.
3. If neither is found, it searches each entry in the PATH environment variable for the command. The PATH variable contains a series of directories separated by colons. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name or explicitly by a single period.
.SH COMMAND EXIT STATUS
Each command has an exit status.
.SH BUILT-INS
This section lists the built-in commands that perform operations not achievable by separate processes:
.TP
.I exit
Exits the shell.
.TP
.I env
Prints the current environment.
.TP
.I cd
Changes the current directory.
.SS Environment
PATH' The default search path for executables.
PWD' The logical value of the current working directory. This is set by the cd command.
OLDPWD' The previous logical value of the current working directory. This is set by the cd command.
